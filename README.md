# YUNO-Generate
## Purpose
Challenged by Clean Code I took my chances on the infamous programming language Objective-C.

Basically this is an attempt to list all design flaws and handle them like any modern language does. Therefore I studied the secret techniques from countless open source libraries in an effort to truly understand the designers themselves.

This shall be achieved in a few simple steps
- Writing a style guide in the wiki
- Crafting a pod

To improve my odds I chose the following weapons
- Objective-C, because every other language is prohibited
 - [CocoaPods](https://github.com/cocoapods/cocoapods)
- JavaScript, to generate the permitted language
 - [Ribosome](https://github.com/sustrik/ribosome)
 - [Node.js](https://github.com/joyent/node)
